# Hangman

This example helps demonstrate how Leo can be used to build a game. Hangman has an element of committing to information on chain, and using that information to update the state of the game. As more functionality is added, this example can be expanded upon to work completely on chain. For now, the state of the chain prevents us from using this game as desired, although the code actually does almost everything we want it to from the perspective of what happens per 'turn' in the game.
